Simple remote expenses tracking system.

INSTALL:

First, some depencencies: 
- git@github.com:jkliff/pgcrud.git as well and set it to your path
- postgres database 9.0 or greater with superuser access (to run bootstrao script; regular access goes through a specific user)
- forever (this is actually no hard dependency, but for convenience to startup and mantain the process running it's a charm); if this is not desired, on may very well use startup_once.sh to run the server. (npm install forever)
- psycopg2 (for python) (for ubuntu, apt-get install libpq-dev, easy_install psycopg2)
- setup ~/.pgcrud/profiles with your database's config

Setup:
- clone this repo
- ./bootstrap.sh DB_HOSTNAME SUPERUSER
- 


TODO: 
- security (authentication and encryption)
- multi user support
- expenses account support
- verify access through cellphone browsers
- error handling and warn user
- externalize database configuration
